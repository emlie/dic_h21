# Design of Integrated Circuits | H21 Group Project
> Be inspired by the paper and design a similar system.
> Design analog circuits in SPICE and digital circuits in SystemVerilog.

## Things missing
- [ ] Add testbench for SPICE: COMP, SENSOR, MEMCELL, MEMORY
- [x] Make the SENSOR
- [x] Make the COMPARATOR
---
## Notes
* We made the SENSOR and COMPARATOR and tested them using the ``pixelSensor_tb.cir`` but we're not sure what the plots mean
